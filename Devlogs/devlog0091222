Which industry role(s) sound the best and/or worst to you?

The role of audio programmer is the most appealing to me because I feel that it corresponds to my strengths best. As a computer science major, I have done an extensive amount of programming, and as a music technology major, I have an in-depth knowledge of sound and audio processing. I also am interested in any roles involving programming of which there can be many. Roles involving visual arts, design, or management of co-workers do not seem well suited for me. I lack the skills to create exceptional art and I worry that I do have the creativity for design -- although it is something I would like to see if I could improve upon. Roles involving management do not appeal to me because I do not see myself as a leader.

Which role(s) was surprising, boring, easy, hard, cheap, expensive, or ____?

I was surprised by the extensive amount of roles listed in the article. I think that game designers have an extremely challenging job because their ideas dictate how all the other members of the team will act. In addition, their ideas must be feasible but also experimental, new, and exciting. That balance seems difficult to achieve and I would argue results in the success of a game if executed correctly. Roles involving marketing or management seem boring to me as I prefer to work directly with the product -- not the consumers.
