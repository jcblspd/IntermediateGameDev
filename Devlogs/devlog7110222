For my midterm project, I created an RPG top down game. I think my project was successful in its implementation of the player's movement, the dialog system, and the sound implementation. The dialog system is triggered by the player colliding with the NPC. Further the dialog is able to adapt to game parameters. When the player collects the eyeballs, the dialog changes. I was able to learn how to use the basics of wwise. I successfully implemented background noises including water dripping and background music that I wrote. I was able to increase the reverb and decrease the volume as the player's distance increased from the river. I am most proud of my implementation of footsteps. The footstep sounds are randomized but are determined by what material the player is standing on. So when the player is walking on the ground, mud footsteps are triggered, but if the player is on the bridge, wood footstep sounds are triggered. I think that my midterm project could be improved with more expansive gameplay and better player interactions with the environment.
